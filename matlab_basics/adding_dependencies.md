# Adding Dependencies in Matlab

Add required dependencies using the GUI Set up or Terminal Set up.

## GUI Set up
Note: This will permanently keep the dependency on Matlab's path so that you do not have to add it every time you start Matlab.
1. Download/Install the given dependency onto your computer.
   - For example, to download the Moxon Lab Matlab-offline-neural-analysis codebase from Github, navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/moxon-lab-codebase/MATLAB-offline-neural-analysis), select the green download 'Code' button, select "Download ZIP", and then "Extract All" files once the download is complete.
2. Add the dependency to the path.
   - In the "Environment" section of the Matlab "Home" tab, select "Set Path", select "Add Folder"/"Add with Subfolders".  
   - For example, to add the Matlab-offline-neural-analysis codebase, select "Set Path", then "Add with Subfolders", and select the location where you saved the extracted files, and select "save".

## Terminal Set up
1. Download the given dependency onto your computer.
2. Use Matlab's `addpath` function to add the dependency to that instance of Matlab
