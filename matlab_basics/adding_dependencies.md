# Adding Dependencies in Matlab

Add required dependencies using the GUI Set up or Terminal Set up.

## GUI Set up
Note: This will permanently keep the dependency on Matlab's path so that you do not have to add it every time you start Matlab.
1. If you have not cloned the respository, downloadand and install it and the dependencies will be included.
   - For example, to download the Moxon Lab Matlab-offline-neural-analysis codebase from Github, navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/moxon-lab-codebase/MATLAB-offline-neural-analysis), select the green download 'Code' button, select "Download ZIP", and then "Extract All" files once the download is complete.
2. Add the dependency to the path in Matlab.
   - In the "Environment" section of the Matlab "Home" tab, select "Set Path", select "Add Folder"/"Add with Subfolders".  
   - For example, to add the Matlab-offline-neural-analysis codebase, select "Set Path", then "Add with Subfolders", and select the location where you saved the extracted files, and select "save".

## Terminal Set up
1. Download the given dependency onto your computer.
2. Use Matlab's `addpath` function to add the dependency to that instance of Matlab
