# How to use the Moxon Laboratory Github

The laboratory follow a set of key rules meant to help streamline the way the codebase is used and updated. You **must** follow them when interacting with internal code, *especially* if you are new to the laboratory. These rules are:

1. You should follow the instructions in our [Git Introduction & Tutorial](https://github.com/NeuralStorm/docs/blob/kev-rewrites/git_setup.md) before using any programs. Make sure that you understand why git is important and how it is properly used before you proceed.    

2. Before using a given program, thoroughly read its documentation.    

3. If you need adjustments to be made to the way a given program works, reach out to Ryan or the author of the branch you are using. Chances are that you misunderstand a configurable part of the code and that changes do not actually need to be made.   

4. To make changes to the code, create your own branch first and push immediately.     

5. Make commits often (ideally daily) and push frequently.    

6. Once you've completed work on your branch, you must reach out to Ryan once again to request that he merge your branch into master.

7. #### At no point should you be creating a branch or merging your code into master or other people's branches without approval.
